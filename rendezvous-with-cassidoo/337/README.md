# daysBetween

[issue #337 of rendezvous with cassidoo.](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/the-most-effective-way-to-do-it-is-to-do-it-5924/)

**Write a function called daysBetween that takes in two dates, and returns the number of days between those dates.**
You can choose the date format you'd like to accept!

Example:

```ts
> daysBetween('Jan 1, 2024', 'Jan 29, 2024')
> 28

> daysBetween('Feb 29, 2020', 'Oct 31, 2023')
> 1340
```
