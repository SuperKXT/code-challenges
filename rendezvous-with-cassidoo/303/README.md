[issue #303 of rendezvous with cassidoo.](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/8309/)

## Description

**Given an array of people objects (where each person has a name and a number of pie pieces theyâ€™re hungry for) and a number for the number of pieces that the pie can be cut into, return the number of pies you need to buy.**

Example:

```ts
/_ cSpell: disable-next-line _/
> arr = [{ name: 'Joe', num: 9 }, { name: 'Cami', num: 3 }, { name: 'Cassidy', num: 4 }]
> mmmPie(arr, 8)
> 2 // 16 pieces needed, pies can be cut into 8 pieces, so 2 pies should be bought
```
