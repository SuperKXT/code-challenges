## Description

**Given an array of strings and a max width, format the text such that each
line has exactly maxWidth characters and is fully justified.
You can choose how you want to wrap a word.**

Example:

```ts
> justifyText(["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."], 16)
> [
    "This    is    an",
    "example  of text",
    "justification.  "
  ]
```
