[issue #282 of rendezvous with cassidoo.](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/the-man-who-moves-a-mountain-begins-by-carrying/)

## Description

**Implement a “spin the wheel” game where the player can bet on each spin of a
wheel and either double their money, lose their money, or keep their money.**

You can choose how the user bets, and what data structures you might want to
use for the player and their money!
