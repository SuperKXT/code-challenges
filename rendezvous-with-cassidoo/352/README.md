# maxProduct

[issue #352 of rendezvous with cassidoo.](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/an-honest-man-is-always-a-child-socrates/)

**Write a function that takes in a list (of length >= 3) of numbers,
and returns the maximum product that can be obtained by multiplying
any three integers from the list.**

Example:

```ts
> maxProduct([2, 4, 1, 3, -5, 6])
> 72 // 4*3*6
```
