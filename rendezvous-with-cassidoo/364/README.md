# squares

[issue #364 of rendezvous with cassidoo.](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/fff/)

**Create a function that should take one argument `n`, which is a positive integer.
The function should return the sum of all squared positive integers between `1` and `n`, inclusive.**

Example:

```ts
> squares(5)
> 55 // 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25
> squares(10)
> 385
> squares(25)
> 5525
> squares(100)
> 338350
```
