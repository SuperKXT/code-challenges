# zerosInFactorial

[issue #384 of rendezvous with cassidoo.](https://buttondown.com/cassidoo/archive/the-future-belongs-to-those-who-believe-in-the/)

At the Magic Cookie Factory, cookies are baked in factorial quantities.
A cookie is "perfectly round" if its size ends with a zero.
Write a function to determine how many perfectly round cookies
will be made when baking with `n!` ingredients.

Example:

```ts
zerosInFactorial(5);
1; // 5! = 120, which has 1 trailing zero

zerosInFactorial(10);
2; // 10! has 2 trailing zeros

zerosInFactorial(100);
24;
```
