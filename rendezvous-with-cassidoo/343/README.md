[issue #343 of rendezvous with cassidoo.](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/if-you-dont-go-towards-the-thing-you-fear-you/)

**Given an integer array arr, return the maximum difference between two successive elements in arr's sorted form.**
Return 0 if there's 0 or 1 elements.

Example:

```ts
> maxGap([3,6,9,1,2])
> 3
```
