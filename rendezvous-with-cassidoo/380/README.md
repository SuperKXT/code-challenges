[issue #380 of rendezvous with cassidoo.](https://buttondown.com/cassidoo/archive/how-beautiful-it-is-to-get-up-and-go-do-something/)

**Santa is conducting his daily roll call for the reindeer, but the printer has mistakenly printed all their names backwards. To take attendance properly, he urgently needs a tool to reverse the reindeer names and put them in alphabetical order! Can you help Santa?**

Example:

```ts
// cSpell: disable
rollCall(["yzneT", "ydissaC", "enimA"]);
["Amine", "Cassidy", "Tenzy"];
rollCall([
	"rennoD",
	"nexiV",
	"recnarP",
	"temoC",
	"neztilB",
	"recnaD",
	"dipuC",
	"rehsaD",
	"hploduR",
]);
[
	"Blitzen",
	"Comet",
	"Cupid",
	"Dancer",
	"Dasher",
	"Donner",
	"Prancer",
	"Rudolph",
	"Vixen",
];

rollCall(["A", "B", "C"]);
["A", "B", "C"];
// cSpell: enable
```
