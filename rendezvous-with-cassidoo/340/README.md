# wordLengthProduct

[issue #340 of rendezvous with cassidoo.](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/dont-let-doubt-stop-you-from-getting-where-you/)

**Given a string array, find the maximum product of word lengths where the words don't share any letters.**

Example:

```ts
> wordLengthProduct(["fish","fear","boo","egg","cake","abcdef"])
> 16 // "fish" and "cake"

> wordLengthProduct(["a","aa","aaa","aaaa"])
> 0 // all of them share "a"
```
