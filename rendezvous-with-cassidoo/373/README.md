**Given a list of ingredients needed for a recipe, represented as strings,
and a list of ingredients you have in your pantry, write a function to return
the minimum number of additional ingredients you need to buy to make the recipe.**

Example:

```ts
Input: recipe = ['eggs', 'flour', 'sugar', 'butter'];
pantry = ['sugar', 'butter', 'milk'];

Output: 2;
```
