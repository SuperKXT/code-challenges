# buildStaircase

[issue #318 of rendezvous with cassidoo.](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/let-us-remember-that-our-voice-is-a-precious-gift/)

**You have n equal-sized blocks and you want to build a staircase with them. Return the number of steps you can fully build.**

Example:

```ts
> buildStaircase(6)
> 3

// #
// ##
// ###

> buildStaircase(9)
> 3 // it takes 10 blocks to make 4 steps

```
