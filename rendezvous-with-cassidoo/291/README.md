# Perform basic math on fractions

[issue #291 of rendezvous with cassidoo.](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/5778/)

## Description

**Write a function that can do the 4 basic operations (add, subtract, multiply and divide) on two fractions. Return the most simplified form of the result. You can assume a non-zero denominator in the input, and donâ€™t use any built-in implementations in your language of choice, if you can!**

Example:

```ts
> fractionMath('3/4', 'add', '3/4')
> "3/2"

> fractionMath('1/8', 'multiply', '2/2')
> "1/8"
```
