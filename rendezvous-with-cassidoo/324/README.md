# lexoNext

[issue #324 of rendezvous with cassidoo.](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/if-you-spend-too-much-time-looking-in-the/)

**Given a number, rearrange its digits to make it the next larger number.**
So not the maximum size it can be, but the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers!

Example:

```ts
> lexoNext(123)
> 132

> lexoNext(314159)
> 314195
```
