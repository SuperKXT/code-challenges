# faultyVowels

[issue #313 of rendezvous with cassidoo.](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/the-road-to-success-is-always-under-construction/)

**You have a faulty keyboard.
Whenever you type a vowel on it (a,e,i,o,u,y), it reverses the string that you have written,
instead of typing the character.
Typing other characters works as expected.
Given a string, return what will be on the screen after typing with your faulty keyboard.**

Example:

/_ cSpell: disable _/

```ts
> faultyVowels('string')
> 'rtsng'

> faultyVowels('hello world!')
> 'w hllrld!'
```
